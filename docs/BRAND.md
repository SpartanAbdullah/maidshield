# Brand and UI Principles

## Design Direction
Odoo-like product UI principles: calm, structured, and productivity-first.

## Core Principles
- Generous whitespace to separate tasks and reduce cognitive load.
- Typography hierarchy that prioritizes scannability over decoration.
- Neutral palette (grays, off-whites, restrained accent) for trust and clarity.
- Consistent spacing scale and layout rhythm across all screens.
- Clear, action-oriented labels and restrained microcopy.

## Component Behavior
- Prefer clear containers/cards for grouped data and form sections.
- Buttons should indicate priority through weight, not loud color volume.
- Inputs should surface validation close to the field with plain-language guidance.
- Tables and summaries should emphasize totals and assumptions first.

## Accessibility Baseline
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text, controls, and states.
- Provide keyboard-accessible navigation and visible focus states.
- Use semantic heading structure for assistive technologies.

## Motion and Feedback
- Keep transitions minimal and purposeful.
- Reserve animation for state change feedback, not decoration.
